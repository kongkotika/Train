    <h2>🚂 Early Beginnings (1820s)</h2>
    <p>
      The Czech Republic’s railway heritage began in <strong>1828</strong> with the horse-drawn line between
      <em>České Budějovice</em> and Linz — one of the first in continental Europe. It carried salt, wood,
      and passengers, sparking industrial progress.
    </p>

    <h2>📈 Industrial Expansion (19th century)</h2>
    <p>
      During the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the Czech lands became a key Central European hub.
      Steam locomotives linked <strong>Prague, Brno, Ostrava</strong> and beyond — transforming mobility and trade.
    </p>

    <h2>🔧 Modernization (20th century)</h2>
    <p>
      After World War II, <strong>ČSD</strong> (Czechoslovak State Railways) modernized its network.
      By the 1990s, the Czech Republic inherited one of Europe’s densest railway systems.
      Today, <strong>České dráhy (ČD)</strong> and private lines continue that proud legacy.
    </p>

    <h2>✨ Fun Fact</h2>
    <p>
      The <strong>Prague–Dresden corridor</strong> is one of Europe’s oldest international routes —
      still running today, blending history with modern comfort.
